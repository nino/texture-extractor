# Texture extractor

This is in the Nino-is-figuring-out-how-Qt-works stage. No features are
implemented.

## Building

You need to have Qt version 6 installed. You can open the project in Qt Creator
and just kinda hit "Run" or you can run

```sh
cmake -Bbuild .
cmake --build build
```

Then the executable should live in the `build` directory.
